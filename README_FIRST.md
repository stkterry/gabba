You'll find everything you need in the README.md.
Just one thing, you can ignore the section about creating the keys_dev.js file if you're pulling from the zip. It already has the appropriate file created. If you need to look at the credentials anyway, you can find them in the CREDENTIALS.txt file.

Thanks!
